## Sealed class
Subclasses of a sealed class must be modified by one of the following:

  - final: No further subclasses are allowed.
    ![final]()
  - sealed: A sealed set of subclasses is allowed.
  - non-sealed: This is a new keyword that allows inheritance by unknown subclasses.
    ![non-sealed]()

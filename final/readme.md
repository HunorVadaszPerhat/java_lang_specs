- [Final variable](#final-variable)

### Final variable
- final variables are constants
- once a final variable is initialized the value cannot be changed
- it is a good practice to name variables with UPPER CASE 
- #### Blank final variables
    - if a final variable is not initialized at the time of the declaration is known as a blank final variable
    - the blank final variable must be initialized

## Dynamic method dispatch

- [Dynamic method dispatch](#dynamic-method-dispatch)

### Dynamic method dispatch
- allows a subclass to override a method of its superclass
- when a method is called on an object, the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) determines which version of the method to execute at runtime, based on the actual type of the object
